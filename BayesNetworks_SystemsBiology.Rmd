## Sampling from the space of connected directed acyclic graphs with uniform probability
random.graph(LETTERS[1:6], num = 2, method = "ic-dag")

## Sampling from the space of the directed acyclic graphs with uniform probability

### MelanÃ§on's MCMC algorithm samples with uniform probability 
### from the space of directed acyclic graphs (not necessarily connected)
random.graph(LETTERS[1:6], method = "melancon")
